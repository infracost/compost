# Compost

## Deprecation notice

⚠️ This repo is now deprecated. ⚠️

We have moved this functionality into the Infracost CLI via the `infracost comment` subcommand. See [the infracost comment docs](https://www.infracost.io/docs/features/cli_commands/#comment-on-pull-requests) for usage.

Compost is for tools that run in CI pipelines and want to post results as pull request/commit comments.

## Install

```sh
npm install -g @infracost/compost
```

## Examples

Detect the current CI environment and update the previously posted comment. If a previous comment hasn't been posted, then this creates a new comment:

```sh
compost autodetect update --body="my comment"
```

Post a new comment:

```sh
compost autodetect new --body="my new comment"
```

Delete the previous posted comments and post a new comment:

```sh
compost autodetect delete-and-new --body="my new comment"
```

Hide the previous posted comments and post a new comment (**Note:** Currently only supported for GitHub):

```sh
compost autodetect hide-and-new --body="my new comment"
```

Get the latest comment that was posted by compost

```sh
compost autodetect latest
```

Post a comment to a specific GitHub pull request:

```sh
compost github update infracost/compost-example pr 3 --body="my PR comment"
```

Post a comment to a specific GitHub commit SHA:

```sh
compost github update infracost/compost-example commit 2ca7182 --body="my commit comment"
```
