# Compost

Compost is for tools that run in CI pipelines and want to post results as pull request/commit comments.

It currently detects the following CI environments:

* Azure DevOps
* Azure DevOps (GitHub)

Coming soon:

* BitBucket
* Circle CI (GitHub)
* CircleCI (BitBucket)

## Install

```sh
npm install -g @infracost/compost
```

## Examples

Detect the current CI environment and update the previously posted comment. If a previous comment hasn't been posted, then this creates a new comment:

```sh
compost autodetect update --body="my comment"
```

Post a new comment:

```sh
compost autodetect new --body="my new comment"
```

Delete the previous posted comments and post a new comment:

```sh
compost autodetect delete-and-new --body="my new comment"
```

Hide the previous posted comments and post a new comment (**Note:** Currently only supported for GitHub):

```sh
compost autodetect hide-and-new --body="my new comment"
```

Get the latest comment that was posted by compost

```sh
compost autodetect latest
```

Post a comment to a specific GitHub pull request:

```sh
compost github infracost/compost-example pr 3 --body="my PR comment"
```

Post a comment to a specific GitHub commit SHA:

```sh
compost github infracost/compost-example commit 2ca7182 --body="my commit comment"
```
